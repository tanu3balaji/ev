AICTE Internship Project (AI/ML Domain – Electric Vehicles)

Duration: 4 Weeks | Start Date: 27th October 2025
Problem Statement
This project aims to develop an AI-driven Charging Infrastructure Demand Forecast System that predicts the future requirement of EV charging stations across regions based on EV population growth, model types, and fuel eligibility data.

Using machine learning, the system analyzes historical EV registration data to forecast regional EV expansion and charging load for the next five years.
A Generative AI component (e.g., GPT integration) automatically produces data-driven policy recommendations, summarizing which states or cities need urgent infrastructure scaling.
